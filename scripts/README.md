# Catalog ingestion & research-agent pipeline

Two-phase pipeline that turns an external product list into the project's core asset (human-verified, source-tagged nutrient data).
Both scripts read credentials from `.env.local` via `node --env-file=.env.local`.

## Phase A — `ingest-petfriends.mjs` (worklist)

Filters `pet-fritends.json` to dry cat food (kg-weight >= 1, excluding wet/treat/sample), normalizes brand names, and inserts `brands` + `foods` skeleton rows (`brand` + `product_name` + `weight_kg`, no nutrients).
Prices are omitted per `BLUEPRINT.md` (pricing is deferred).
The skeleton rows are the **curation worklist** for the protected `/new/research` workflow.

```bash
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/ingest-petfriends.mjs --dry   # preview, no writes
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/ingest-petfriends.mjs         # ingest
```

Requires migration `0003_foods_external_source.sql` and is idempotent on `(source, external_id)`.
Rows created by the pre-0003 fallback have NULL identifiers and are skipped rather than guessed into a new source identity.

## Phase B — source-first curation

For a skeleton row, a human curator registers manufacturer or Korean-label product URLs in `/new/research`.
The server captures bounded source text, an LLM extracts candidates from that captured text only, and the curator explicitly applies evidence-backed values as a DRAFT.
The workflow leaves `data_verified_at` null until human verification.
Derived values remain server-derived.

## Reference data — `수입사료정리 - DB.csv`

The founder's 2023 curated nutrient sheet (~290 rows, English brand names).
It is a **reference / validation source, not a direct ingest source**: it has final nutrient values but **no per-field source tags**, so ingesting it would violate the measured-vs-estimated source-tagging invariant — and it is stale (BLUEPRINT says re-collect).
Use it to cross-check the source-first curation output, not to populate `nutrient_sources` directly.
